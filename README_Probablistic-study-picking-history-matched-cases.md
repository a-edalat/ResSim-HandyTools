# Probablistic-study-picking-history-matched-cases

Picks the cases which match history matching criteria in a probablistic study run by ECLIPSE based on 
requested summary vector of 'OFM' and 'SEPARATE'.

Gives you the option to select what range of mismatch between cummulative production of gas or water 
with the observed data you are tolerating

I will update this in the future to include, checking mismatch for rates and bhp on specific dates
