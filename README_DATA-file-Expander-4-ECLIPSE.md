# DATA file Expander for ECLIPSE

If you have a DATA file with a lot of include files in ECLIPSE(Numerical Simulator by Schlumberger) and you wish to have a clean file with all the DATA in a single file, this is the tool for you.

I found it easier for me when I work in a new project to be able to see the whole DATA file as once, rather than dealing with all the different include files.

Current version, you can select to have COORD and ZCORD information to be included in the final file or not, as they are generally little value to my purpose and they make working with the final file difficult.

Please share with me your comments, on both how to improve my code and also what other possible features you wish to see in this expander.

Note:
If you are new to Python and not sure how to open this file, visit 'https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/' and download the latest version of Anaconda for your device, in a rare case that you need Admin access contact your IT.

Thanks,
Amin
