# Moving-Simulation-results-in-a-MEPO-run-for-plotting
The goal here is to move the UNSMRY and SMSPEC files for a simulation result to a new folder, renamed it to its MEPO study name, to be able to plot it in Petrel or similar plotting tools.

The advantage of this script is, it can be added to MEPO post-processing workflow, so even after you finished all your runs in MEPO
you can use this to move the desired files. Needless to say you needed to ask MEPO to keep the files for you and to not remove them.
